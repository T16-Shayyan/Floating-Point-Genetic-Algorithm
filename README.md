# Floating-Point-Genetic-Algorithm
Developed a floating-point vector genetic algorithm in Common Lisp by implementing tournament selection, uniform crossover, Gaussian mutation, and a full evolutionary loop. Tuned parameters and tested on benchmark objective functions to achieve near-optimal convergence and robust stochastic performance.
